Plan to build a visually attractive, interactive website for HenKem Kenya Electrical Constructors Company that:
* - Showcases the company's work (images, videos, etc)
* - Includes a contact form/details page
* - Is fast, simple and user-friendly
* - Works well even in low or no internet environments (or is at least resilient)
* - Is easy to maintain and scale

The following are the best tools and strategies for each part of this project

## 1. Best Language/Technology used for frontend

### React + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
* - **React:** Highly inteructive UI, reusable components
* - **Tailwind CSS:** Fast styling with utility classes
* - **Framer Motion:** Smooth, modern animations

**Why these combo?**
* - Interactive and smooth animations
* - Mobile-friendly and responsive
* - Can be turned into a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - works offline or in poor internet conditions

## 2. Static files (images, videoa and other files) storages
* - Stores optimized images and videos in a cloud storage buckets:
*   - **Clouddinary** for images and videos, provides transformations and CDN
*   - **Firebase** storage integration with Firebase backend
*   - **AWS S3** for flexibility

* - Store file URLs in the database

### Implemented practices
* - Compress media files i.e images and high resolution videos
* - Used lazy loading to reduce initial load time

## 3. Database & Backend (for contact forms, media references and other implementations)

### Databases implemented and their cases:
| Use Case                      | Database          | Why?                                                                  |
| Simple site + contact form    | **Firebase**      | Fast setup, real-time updates, easy with authentication               |
| Advanced backend              | **PostgreSQL**    | Powerful, relational DB, good for forms, user data, media references  |
| Serverless DB                 | **Supabase**      | PostgreSQL-based, with Firebase-like APIs                             |

### Backend Language/Framework options:
* **Node.js with Expresss or Next.js API routes**: Most common, works well with React
* **>Net (C#)** best for Microsoft stack
* **Python (Flask or FastAPI)** for quick, easy REST API development
